        <p> Learning Chinese, Japanese and Korean at the same time can seem like a impossible task but it also offers unique advantages that can turn the challenge into a rewarding experience.

        <h4 class="sub-title" id="beginner">Cross‑Language Reinforcement</h4>
        <p>When you encounter a Chinese character in a Japanese text, you instantly see its Korean hanja counterpart. This tri‑modal reinforcement—visual (the character), auditory (pronunciation in each language), and semantic (meaning)—creates stronger memory traces than studying a single language in isolation. For example, the character 学 (meaning “study”) appears as xué in Mandarin, がく (gaku) in Japanese, and 학 (hak) in Korean. Seeing it three times in a short period cements both its shape and its core concept.</p>
        <br>
        
        <h4 class="sub-title" id="beginner">Cognitive Transfer</h4>
        <p>Research on multilingualism shows that learning related languages enhances executive functions such as task switching and inhibitory control. The mental gymnastics required to keep Mandarin tones separate from Japanese pitch‑accent and Korean vowel harmony act as a workout for the brain, leading to improved problem‑solving abilities outside language study.</p>

        <h3 class="section-title" id="tools">Useful Tools</h3>
        <p>Below is a list of tools that may be helpful to you when studying Japanese. Feel free to try some of them out!</p>
        <br>

        <h4 class="sub-title" id="anki">Lets Learn Hangul - <a href="http://letslearnhangul.com/" target="_blank">http://letslearnhangul.com/</a></h4>
        <p>It is a great website for quickly learning Hangul.</p>
        <br>
        
        <h4 class="sub-title" id="anki">Anki - <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/" target="_blank">https://apps.ankiweb.net/</a></h4>
        <p>Anki is a SRS flashcard application which is extremely helpful in the beginning for expanding your vocabulary or kanji knowledge. Itazura Neko has <a href="https://kenrick95.github.io/itazuraneko/learn/anki" target="_blank">a nice guide</a> on getting started with it.</p>
        <br>
        
        <h4 class="sub-title" id="jisho">Jisho - <a href="https://jisho.org/" target="_blank">https://jisho.org/</a></h4>
        <p>Jisho is a free online Japanese-English dictionary which is useful for looking up words you don't know.</p>
        <br>
        
        <h4 class="sub-title" id="capture2text">Capture2Text - <a href="https://capture2text.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">https://capture2text.sourceforge.net/</a></h4>
        <p>Capture2Text is an OCR program and is VERY useful for copying unknown kanji from games, manga, etc. I often use this in tandem with Yomichan's search page to quickly look up the meanings of words without having to paste things into Jisho.</p>
        <br>
        
        <h4 class="sub-title" id="yomichan">Yomichan - <a href="https://foosoft.net/projects/yomichan/" target="_blank">https://foosoft.net/projects/yomichan/</a></h4>
        <p>Yomichan is an incredible extension for studying Japanese. You can quickly look up words you don't know with it while reading or generate Anki flashcards with it. As I mentioned above, I often use this in tandem with Capture2Text while playing games, as the search page, which can automatically search your copied texts, is very handy for quickly looking up words or kanji (<a href="../../resources/images/general/demo.jpg" target="_blank">example</a>).</p>
        <br>
        
        <h4 class="sub-title" id="kanjitomo">KanjiTomo - <a href="https://www.kanjitomo.net/" target="_blank">https://www.kanjitomo.net/</a></h4>
        <p>KanjiTomo is a nice OCR application for reading manga, if you have the images on hand. It has a built in dictionary which makes looking up words or kanji you don't know a breeze.</p>
        <br>
        
        <h4 class="sub-title" id="animebook">Animebook - <a href="https://github.com/animebook/animebook.github.io" target="_blank">https://github.com/animebook/animebook.github.io</a></h4>
        <p>Animebook is a video player with navigable subtitles, and since it's in the browser, you can quickly look up words in the subs with Yomichan. It makes practicing both listening and reading with Anime a ton of fun!</p>
        <br>
        
        <h4 class="sub-title" id="other">Other Resources - <a href="https://github.com/stars/SethClydesdale/lists/japanese-resources" target="_blank">https://github.com/stars/SethClydesdale/lists/japanese-resources</a></h4>
        <p>This list contains various projects on GitHub that I found useful for studying Japanese, some of which have already been mentioned above. I occasionally add new things to it, so feel free to check it out.</p>
